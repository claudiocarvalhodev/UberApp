## About

Hi! This project is a study of how to build a fully functioning clone of the famous Uber application. The app was build from the ground up, fully programmatically without the use of storyboards.

In addition, I used Firebase for backend database, which engineer completely from scratch. Along the way, I learned a lot of kinds of advanced programming techniques, best practices, professional architecture, and more!

My goal was to build production ready applications, that are easily scalable and maintainable.
